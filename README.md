# Watchy - Work in Progress personal Fork

This is a battery conservative fork.  I enabled the only wakeup as the acceloremeter tilt to update the time.  I also enabled the doubleClick feature to show a Bible Verse.  The doubleClick is very sensitive and goes off all the time. I need to play with the sensitivity setting, but have fun with it :)
