# Watchy - Work in Progress personal Fork

![Watchy](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/img/watchy_render.png)

This is a very battery conservative fork.  I enabled basically the only wakeup is the acceloremeter tilt to update the time.  I also enabled the doubleClick feature to show a Bible Verse.  The doubleClick is very sensitive, I need to play with the sensativity.
